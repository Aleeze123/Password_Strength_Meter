## How It Works ⚙️

The **Password_Strength_Meter** evaluates your password based on the following factors:

- **Length** 📏: Longer passwords are generally stronger.
- **Character Variety** 🔤: Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters make passwords harder to guess.
- **Dictionary Words** 🔎: Avoid using simple dictionary words to enhance security.

As you type your password, the meter adjusts, and you receive feedback on how to improve it. A strong password will receive a green mark ✅, while a weak one will encourage you to make changes.
